Go Packages

## Reference implementation

This repository contains a reference client and server implementation written in
Go. They can be used standalone but the packages in this repository are
primarily designed to be imported into larger applications.

## Status

The Moonbeam protocol and reference implementation are still experimental.
They may still undergo non-backwards compatible changes.
The reference implementation requires further hardening.
